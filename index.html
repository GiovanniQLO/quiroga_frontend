        <h3>Immigration Medical Exam: Key for Green Card</h3>
        <p>
          To obtain permanent residency in the U.S., it is essential to pass a
          medical exam conducted by a USCIS-authorized physician. This exam,
          valid for six months, includes an evaluation of your medical history,
          a comprehensive physical examination, and the presentation of an
          updated vaccination record.
