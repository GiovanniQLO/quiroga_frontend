            Former President Donald Trump’s proposed mass deportation plan

          <h3>Immigration Medical Exam: Key for Green Card</h3>
          <p>
            To obtain permanent residency in the U.S., it is essential to pass a
            medical exam conducted by a USCIS-authorized physician. This exam,
            valid for six months, includes an evaluation of your medical
            history, a comprehensive physical examination, and the presentation
            of an updated vaccination record.
